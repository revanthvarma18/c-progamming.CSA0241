Compile and Execute the C program to find the Factorial of a positive integer (number) is the sum of multiplication of all the integers smaller than that positive integer. N! is denoted as factorial of N 
#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{
    int n, i;
    unsigned long long fact = 1;
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n < 0)
        printf("Error! Factorial of a negative number doesn't exist.");
    else {
        for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            fact *= i;
        }
        printf("Factorial of %d = %llu", n, fact);
    }
    return 0;
}
